# Project Title: AlgoDuel

## Inspiration
The inspiration for AlgoDuel came from my own experiences as a budding programmer. I often found myself seeking a platform where I could not only practice coding but also engage in a bit of healthy competition. The thrill of solving problems in real-time against peers across the globe struck me as an exciting way to learn.

## What I Learned
Throughout the development of AlgoDuel, I learned a great deal about full-stack development. Working with technologies like React, Node.js, GitHub, and auth0 was enlightening. I also improved my understanding of real-time data handling using WebRTC. This project was a journey in enhancing both my technical skills and my problem-solving abilities.

## How I Built It
The journey of building AlgoDuel began with designing its architecture. I used React for the frontend to create a dynamic and responsive user interface. The backend was powered by Node.js and Express. I used auth0 for authorization. The integration of WebRTC allowed for real-time communication during matches.

## Challenges Faced
One of the biggest challenges was implementing the real-time features. Ensuring that the coding duels were synchronized across different clients in real-time required meticulous planning and testing. Another challenge was optimizing the platform for various devices, ensuring a seamless user experience everywhere.
